Cesspit Rails
=============

Find unused CSS in your Rails applications.

Usage
-----

Include `cesspit_rails` in your `Gemfile`:

~~~ ruby
group :test
  gem 'cesspit_rails'
end
~~~

Now you can reference assets generated by the [Rails Asset Pipeline](http://guides.rubyonrails.org/asset_pipeline.html) when running your tests.

~~~ shell
# When run individually
ruby test/home_controller_test.rb --cesspit application.css

# With Rake:
TESTOPTS="--cesspit application.css" rake test
~~~
